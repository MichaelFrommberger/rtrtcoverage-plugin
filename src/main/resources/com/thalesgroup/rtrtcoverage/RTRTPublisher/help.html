<p>This plugin aims at recording RTRT test coverage reports, and displaying code coverage,
for C and Ada languages. It requires the following input files:</p>
<ul>
<li>.fdc files: generated by RTRT during build, a FDC file contains the
corresponding source file structure (functions, branches, decisions, etc.)</li>
<li>.tio files: gererated during test run, TIO files contain the test coverage data
(coverage of source files branches by each test).</li>
<li>instrumented source files: generated by RTRT during build, an instrumented source file
contains in particular the checksums that identify the source file, and are refered to
in tio files. [Note: if the source files checksums generation algorithm used by RTRT
were documented, then instrumented files would not be required.]</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, if the workspace contains the following directory tree:<p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/</li>
<li><code>build/src_ins</code>: source files intrumented by RTRT, named e.g.
 <code><em>sourcefile</em>.cov.c</code> for C sources,
 or <code>ATC_<em>sourcefile</em>_adb.adb</code> for Ada sources</li>
<li><code>build/traces</code>: <code>.tio</code> RTRT trace files</li>
</ul>
then the plugin configuration may be:
<ul>
<li>Files containing RTRT .tio reports: <code>build/traces/**/*.tio</code></li>
<li>RTRT .fdc static coverage files pattern: <code>build/FDC/**/*.fdc</code></li>
<li>Instrumented files pattern: <code>build/src_ins/**/*.cov.c</code> for C files,
or <code>build/src_ins/**/*_adb.adb</code> for Ada files</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Warning:</b> the instrumented file pattern is used to compute the original source file
name from the instrumented file name. For instance, if an instrumented file name is
<code>sourcefile_cov.c</code> and the pattern is <code>**/*_cov.c</code>, then the final
prefix <code>_cov.c</code> is stripped from the instrumented filename:
<code>sourcefile</code>, and finally the <code>.c</code> file extension is added
to get the original source file name: <code>sourcefile.c</code>. So it is important that
the configured instrumented file pattern contains exactly the instrumented file suffix.</p>
